= Management Console

Provides HAL, the {WildFly} management console.
It can access an existing WildFly or Thorntail server over the HTTP management protocol.
In both cases, management API of the target server must be configured for Cross-Origin Resource Sharing.

In the examples below, we assume that the console is accessible on `http://localhost:8080/console`.

.WildFly

Run the following WildFly CLI commands to let the console access the management API:

[source]
--
/core-service=management/management-interface=http-interface:list-add(name=allowed-origins,value='http://localhost:8080')

reload
--

.Thorntail

Make sure your Thorntail application includes the `management` fraction.

Include the following in your `project-defaults.yml`:

[source]
--
thorntail:
  management:
    http-interface-management-interface:
      allowed-origins:
      - "http://localhost:8080"
--
